# ICSimulator
Use ATMega328P to simulator different IC

ATmega328P is powerful enough to simulate the functionalities of another chip. This will enable people to test their ideas when not having a special IC on hand.
The simulator may not be able to provide all functions of the IC, but it can provide the mainly used features of the IC.

## Functionalities
- EEPROM
  - AT24C02 etc.
- GPIO Expander
  - PCF8574 etc.
- RTC
  - DS1307 etc.
- LED Display Driver
  - MAX7219 MAX7221 etc.
- ADC
- PWM
- Bridge
    - I2C to SPI bridge(SC18IS602B)
    - I2C/SPI to UART Bridge(SC16IS750)
